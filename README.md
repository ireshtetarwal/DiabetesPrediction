# Diabetes Prediction Model

A machine learning-based application that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on various health metrics. Built using Python and scikit-learn with proper preprocessing and model evaluation.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🔍 Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed medical dataset
- Built a predictive classification model
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Evaluated model with accuracy score, confusion matrix, etc.

## 📋 ML Workflow
- Data loading and cleansing
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Performance evaluation using metrics and plots

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone/download the repository
2. Open `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run the cells step-by-step to see preprocessing, model training, and predictions
